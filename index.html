          <p><strong><em>Welcome to the Darkness Overload landing page!, if you are not already familiar with this mod and it capabilities thats ok. what we attempted to do, was recreate classic versions of Riku throughout the Kingdom Hearts francise along their own unique movesets and transformations. 
            in order to make this possible we used the Equinox framework that was previously created by Kurasa Nick.</em></strong></p>
